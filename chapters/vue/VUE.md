# Vue

Go to your terminal or command line.

## Go to your projects folder

In case you don't already have a projects folder, create one with `mkdir projects`. Then go to that folder.

```
cd projects
```

### Create a project

Change `my-project` to anything you like. The `--` is important and is not a typo.

```
npm init vite@latest my-project -- --template vue
```

### Go the your project folder.

```
cd my-project
```

### Run the installation

```
npm install
```

### Test the project

To start the server, start it with the below.

```
npm dev
```

To make sure the server is working go to `https://localhost:3000` or where it says it's installed.
